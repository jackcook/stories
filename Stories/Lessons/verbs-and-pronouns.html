    <h1>Verbs and Pronouns</h1>
    <img src="verbs-and-pronouns.jpg" />
    <ul>
      <li>A verb is a word that tells you what someone does: eat, sleep, work, love</li>
      <br>
      <li>A pronoun is a word that replaces a person or a thing: I, you, he, she ... </li>
      <br>
      <li>When we combine pronouns and verbs, we basically only allow certain endings, e.g. I drink &mdash; he drinks</li>
    </ul>
    <br>

      <tr>
        <td>je</td>
        <td>I</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>tu</td>
        <td>you (informal singular)</td>

        <td>il</td>
        <td>he</td>

      <tr>
        <td>vous</td>
        <td>you (plural, formal singular)</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>ils</td>
        <td>they (males)</td>

    <ul>
      <li>Unlike English, French has two words for &quot;you&quot;: &quot;vous&quot; and &quot;tu&quot;. It is important to know when to use each one.</li>
      <li>&quot;Vous&quot; is the plural form of &quot;you&quot;. It is used to show respect. </li>
      Note: Use it when you are talking to someone important, someone who is older than you, or someone you are unfamiliar with.
      <li>&quot;Tu&quot; is the singular and more informal form of &quot;you&quot;.</li>
      Note: Use it when you are referring to a friend or family member, or when addressing a child and with someone who you would call by his/her first name.
    </ul>
    Note:
    There is no &quot;it&quot; form in French. Everything is either masculine or feminine, and therefore referred to as &quot;il&quot; or &quot;elle&quot;.
